            Space Foods Company was an American business located in Baltimore,
              Maryland. An idea before it's time, the company developed a line
              called Galaxy Home Syrups...for Soft Drinks. The homemade soda kit
              collection consisted of 10 different ranks of the crew members
              with 8 different colors. The bottles also had a screw-on cap with
              flavor label. The five flavors were Cherry, Raspberry, Lemon-lime,
              Grape and Orange. The caps also include a slot that allowed the
              bottles to be used as a coin bank to hold what we now call "old
              dumb money".
              <br />
              <br />
              These awesome bottles were put into production and boxed in cases
              of 12. We do not know when the company planned to launch these
              kits to the public, but in 1953 Space Foods Company filed for
              bankruptcy and deemed the initial launch a failure.
              <br />
              <br />
              Almost 20 years later in 1971, our Space Ace's grandfather
              purchased a building for his manufacturing company. To his
              surprise, the building came with more than just factory floor
              space. The upstairs was home to thousands of these boxed crew
              members, who never had the chance to complete their launch. Space
              Ace's family has sold a few to collectors, antique stores and even
              a local restaurant but never found a way to tell the story of
              these bottles. Until now. Now, Space Foods Company has the
              opportunity to tell the story of these unique antique bottles. A
              story that we will tell together as a community through our art
              inspired by the physical bottles themselves! Join us in our new
              mission to share a piece of untold history with the world.
