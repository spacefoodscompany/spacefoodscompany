                <p>
                Space Foods Company was an American business located in Baltimore,
                Maryland. An idea before it's time, the company developed a line
                called Galaxy Home Syrups...for Soft Drinks. The homemade soda kit
                collection consisted of 10 different ranks of the crew members
                with 8 different colors. The bottles also had a screw-on cap with
                flavor label. The five flavors were Cherry, Raspberry, Lemon-lime,
                Grape and Orange. These awesome bottles were put into production
                and boxed in cases of 12. We don't know when the company planned
                to launch these kits to the public, but in 1953 Space Foods
                Company filed for bankruptcy and deemed the initial launch a
                failure.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 1971, our Space Ace's grandfather purchased a building for his
                manufacturing company. To his surprise, the building came with
                more than just factory floor space. The upstairs was home to
                thousands of these boxed crew members, who never had the chance to
                complete their launch. Space Ace's family has sold a few to
                collectors, but never found a way to tell the story of these
                bottles. Until now. Now, Space Foods Company has the opportunity
                to tell the story of these unique antique bottles. A story that we
                will tell together as a community through our art inspired by the
                physical bottles themselves!

              Not long after the end of WWII, The Space Race kicked off between 
              the U.S. and Soviet Russia - a competition between two powerful 
              nations to build a superior technology strong enough for space travel 
              capabilities. Many great achievements emerged from this race starting with 
              the launch of Sputnik in ’57, to Apollo 11 landing on the moon in ’69. 
              As momentous as these achievements were at the time, there was something 
              far more intriguing conspiring several years before…
              <br />
              <br />
              Our story begins in 1947, the year a UFO crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico. 
              For the last 69 years, the events that transpired the day of the crash have been 
              strongly kept secret. Until now…
              <br />
              <br />
              Now we will finish our story starting in 1953 when Space Foods Company mysteriously
              halted it’s operation. As a community we will complete this untold story through a 
              series of writing and art competitions. The winner for each chapter will win a variety 
              of prizes from physical bottles, unique merch and even 1 of 1 NFTs. We will start the 
              competition once we have grown our community to 1,953 prospective crew members so please 
              help us recruit those you would like to travel the cosmos with.

              why were operations mysteriously halted in 1953? In this challenge, we want you to
              help us kick off the first episode of our story. Use your imagination and be as 
              creative as possible. At the end, we will hold a vote to determine the winner who will
