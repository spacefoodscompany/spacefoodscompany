            <p>
              Space Foods Company was an American business located in Baltimore,
              Maryland. An idea before it's time, the company developed a line
              called Galaxy Home Syrups...for Soft Drinks. The homemade soda kit
              collection consisted of 10 different ranks of the crew members
              with 8 different colors. The bottles also had a screw-on cap with
              flavor label. The five flavors were Cherry, Raspberry, Lemon-lime,
              Grape and Orange. These awesome bottles were put into production
              and boxed in cases of 12. We don't know when the company planned
              to launch these kits to the public, but in 1953 Space Foods
              Company filed for bankruptcy and deemed the initial launch a
              failure.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 1971, our Space Ace's grandfather purchased a building for his
              manufacturing company. To his surprise, the building came with
              more than just factory floor space. The upstairs was home to
              thousands of these boxed crew members, who never had the chance to
              complete their launch. Space Ace's family has sold a few to
              collectors, but never found a way to tell the story of these
              bottles. Until now. Now, Space Foods Company has the opportunity
              to tell the story of these unique antique bottles. A story that we
              will tell together as a community through our art inspired by the
              physical bottles themselves!

            <p>
                Not long after WWII had ended, The Space Race kicked off between 
                the U.S. and Soviet Russia - a competition between two powerful 
                nations to build a superior technology strong enough for space travel 
                capabilities. Many great achievements emerged from this race starting with 
                the launch of Sputnik in ’57, to Apollo 8 landing on the moon in ’68. 
                As momentous as these achievements were at the time, there was something 
                far more intriguing conspiring several years before…
                <br />
                <br />
                Our story begins in 1947, the year a UFO crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico. 
                For 69 years the events that transpired the day of the crash have been 
                strongly kept secret. Until now…
                <br />
                <br />
                Soon after the crash, the United States government constructed a team of 
                highly intelligent scientists and highly trained solders to investigate the 
                scene. What they found, was shocking. Head scientist Dr. Hahn reported their 
                findings back to the CIA and thus Space Foods Company was formed.
